        <h1>Brian May</h1>
        <p class="text">
            Brian Harold May CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English guitarist, singer, composer, and astrophysicist. He achieved fame as lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor. His songwriting contributions helped Queen become one of the most successful bands in rock history.

        <p class="text">
            May previously performed with Taylor in the blues rock band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. After Queen's formation in 1970, bass player John Deacon joined to complete the line-up in 1971. They became one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album A Night at the Opera and its single "Bohemian Rhapsody". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen played at some of the biggest venues in the world, including at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician. He was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special.[3] May wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "We Will Rock You", "I Want It All", "Fat Bottomed Girls", "Flash", "Hammer to Fall", "Save Me", "Who Wants to Live Forever", "Too Much Love Will Kill You", and "The Show Must Go On".

            Following the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the 1992 tribute concert, the release of Made in Heaven (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, "No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the seventh-greatest guitarist of all time.[4] He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".[5] In 2012, he was ranked the second-greatest guitarist in a Guitar World magazine readers poll.[6] In 2001, May was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Queen and in 2018 the band received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[7]

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p class="text">
            May was born 19 July 1947[14] in a nursing home at Hampton Hill, near Twickenham, Middlesex,[15][16] the only child of Ruth Irving (n√©e Fletcher) and Harold May, who worked as a draughtsman at the Ministry of Aviation.[17][18] His mother who was Scottish, married his father who was English at Moulin in Perthshire, Scotland in 1946.[19] May attended the local Hanworth Road state primary school, and at the age of 11 won a scholarship to Hampton Grammar School,[16] then a voluntary aided school.[15][17][20] During this time, he formed his first band, named 1984 after George Orwell's novel of the same name, with vocalist and bassist Tim Staffell.[21]

            At Hampton Grammar School, May attained ten GCE Ordinary Levels and three GCE Advanced Levels in Physics, Mathematics, and Applied Mathematics.[21] He studied Mathematics and Physics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc degree in Physics in 1968 with honours.[22] Following his graduation, May received a personal invitation from Sir Bernard Lovell to work at the Jodrell Bank Observatory while continuing to prepare his doctorate. He declined, choosing instead to remain at Imperial College to avoid breaking from Smile, the London-based band he was in at the time.[23]
